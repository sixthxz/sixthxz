$$E_{perceived} = mc^2 + \hbar \cdot \frac{\Delta I \cdot \nabla \Phi(t)}{(\omega^2 + \lambda(R+D))(1+S)} \cdot \varphi(\gamma)$$

| **Symbol**              | **Meaning**                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **$E_{perceived}$**      | Energy structured within the conscious universe of the observer (meaningful experience).                           |
| **$mc^2$**               | Base material energy (biological support of the observer, immediate physical environment).                         |
| **$\hbar$**              | Planck's constant: the quantum relationship between action and information.                                        |
| **$\Delta I$**           | Variation in available information (potential order in the field).                                                 |
| **$\nabla \Phi(t)$**     | Gradient of the perceptual possibilities field (change in the quantum landscape of decision).                       |
| **$\omega^2$**           | Inertia or natural frequency of the system (internal resistance to structural change).                             |
| **$\lambda(R + D)$**     | Total curvature of the informational environment: $R$ (visible) + $D$ (non-collapsed/unconscious).                 |
| **$S$**                  | Perceptual entropy: disorder, noise, internal uncertainty in the conscious system.                                 |
| **$\varphi(\gamma)$**    | Structural activation of the observer: their capacity to collapse possibilities and construct reality.              |

#### General Explanation:

The equation describes how various quantum and perceptual factors interact to form the **structured energy** within the conscious experience of the observer. The term involving Planck's constant ($\hbar$) , the variation of information ($\Delta I$), and the gradient of the perceptual field  $\nabla \Phi(t)$ highlights the role of **quantum information** and how the observerâ€™s decisions affect **reality**. The other terms adjust the physical system according to **inertia**, the **curvature** of the environment, and the **possibilities of collapsing realities**.
